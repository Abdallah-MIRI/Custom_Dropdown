# a custom dropdown using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to create a fully custom dropdown using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
It includes all states of a dropdown component:

---

### **Default State / No Item Selected**

The dropdown shows a placeholder text before any selection.

---

### **Open State / No Selection**

When the dropdown is opened, all items become visible.

---

### **Open State / Has Selection**

If an item was previously selected, it appears highlighted when the dropdown is opened again.

---

### **Selected Item State / Example: “Third Item”**

After selecting an item, the dropdown closes and shows the chosen value.
